# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This document outlines the Security Policy for my information. 
It emphasizes our commitment to maintain a secure environment for our users and contributors, and reflects our belief in the power of collaboration to identify and resolve security vulnerabilities.

This policy applies to all open source projects developed, maintained, or hosted here.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.0.x   | :x:                |
| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Upon receiving a report of a potential vulnerability, our team will initiate an investigation. If the reported issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, we will take the following steps:
Acknowledgment: We will acknowledge the receipt of your vulnerability report and begin our investigation.
    Validation: We will validate the issue and work on reproducing it in our environment.
    Remediation: We will work on a fix and thoroughly test it.
    Release & Disclosure: After 60 days from the discovery of the vulnerability, or as soon as a fix is ready and thoroughly tested (whichever comes first), we will release an update for the affected project. We will also publicly disclose the vulnerability by publishing a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), if applicable and acknowledging the discovering party.
    Exceptions: In order to preserve the security of the community at large, we might extend the disclosure period to allow users to patch their deployments.


This  period allows for end-users to update their systems and minimizes the risk of widespread exploitation of the vulnerability.

## Automatic Scanning
We leverage GitHub Actions to perform automated scans of our supply chain. These scans assist us in identifying vulnerabilities and outdated dependencies in a proactive and timely manner.

## Changes to this Security Policy
This policy may be revised from time to time. Each version of the policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date.
